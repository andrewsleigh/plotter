# Readme

These parts are for version 1 of the plotter. This version uses a roller to move the paper on the y-axis. It has been superseded by version 2 which uses a more traditional cartesian format.

These are STL exports from Fusion 360. There is also a Fusion 360 archive file of the whole model.

If you'd like to remix this model, please take a look at the [Thingiverse project page](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3986756) and consider adding attribution there.
